{"q": "What is the Lava Gun in UYA multiplayer?", "a": "The Lava Gun is a short-range continuous beam weapon that acts like a flamethrower, projecting a stream of superheated lava."}
{"q": "How does the Lava Gun fire?", "a": "It fires a continuous lava stream while the trigger is held down, dealing steady damage over time."}
{"q": "How fast does the Lava Gun use ammo?", "a": "Its ammo depletes rapidly as the beam is used."}
{"q": "What is the ammo capacity of the Lava Gun?", "a": "The Lava Gun holds 250 units of ammo."}

{"q": "Who is the Lava Gun effective against?", "a": "It is especially strong against agile players and those using short-range weapons like shotguns."}
{"q": "Can the Lava Gun’s beam bend during use?", "a": "Yes. If the player spins, the beam curves slightly, allowing it to track targets or arc around them."}
{"q": "What is the 'bendy lava whip' effect?", "a": "It refers to the Lava Gun’s beam bending while turning, making it deadly in tight spaces."}
{"q": "What happens when the Lava Gun is upgraded?", "a": "After 3 kill assists, it upgrades to a stronger version with more range and faster kill speed."}
{"q": "How fast can the upgraded Lava Gun kill?", "a": "It can kill in about 2 seconds of contact, down from 4 seconds in its base form."}
{"q": "Does the upgraded Lava Gun freeze enemies?", "a": "No. Unlike in single-player, it remains a lava weapon in multiplayer and does not freeze enemies."}
{"q": "What changes in the upgraded Lava Gun from single-player?", "a": "In single-player it becomes the Liquid Nitrogen Gun, but in multiplayer it only gains range and damage."}
{"q": "How is the Lava Gun used for area denial?", "a": "It can block choke points, guard flags, and deter enemies from entering close-range zones."}
{"q": "What happens to enemies who enter the Lava Gun's radius?", "a": "They are often forced to retreat or are quickly killed before they can react."}
{"q": "What is the Lava Gun’s role in competitive multiplayer?", "a": "It is a lethal close-range weapon ideal for defending tight spaces or objectives indoors."}
{"q": "Why is the Lava Gun not viable in open-field combat?", "a": "Its short range limits its usefulness in open areas where distance weapons dominate."}
{"q": "What weapon type is the Lava Gun?", "a": "The Lava Gun is a flamethrower-style beam that projects continuous super-heated lava at short range."}
{"q": "How does the Lava Gun fire?", "a": "Holding the trigger emits a steady stream; ammo drains continuously instead of in discrete shots."}
{"q": "What is the Lava Gun’s ammo reserve?", "a": "It carries 250 ammo units that deplete rapidly while firing, encouraging burst use to conserve fuel."}
{"q": "Why is the Lava Gun lethal up close?", "a": "Targets caught in the beam take instant, uninterrupted damage, dying in roughly 3–4 seconds at base level."}
{"q": "Can the Lava beam bend?", "a": "Turning while firing creates a slight ‘whip’ letting the stream curve around small corners or track moving foes."}
{"q": "What changes with an upgraded Lava Gun?", "a": "After 3 kills it gains extended range and doubles kill speed, but stays a lava projector rather than freezing targets."}
{"q": "How does Lava Gun deny areas?", "a": "Spraying lava across a doorway or tunnel forces enemies to retreat or risk rapid death, making it ideal for flag or node defense."}
{"q": "Where is the Lava Gun strongest?", "a": "It excels on small maps or tight rooms where short lines of sight make escaping the beam difficult."}
{"q": "How is the Lava Gun viewed competitively?", "a": "Top players treat it as a situational powerhouse—weak at range but unmatched for close-quarters defense on maps like Sewers or Docks."}
{"q": "What drawback limits Lava Gun use?", "a": "Its very short range leaves the user vulnerable to long-range weapons if opponents keep distance."}
{"q": "Why is ammo management vital for Lava Gun?", "a": "Continuous firing empties its 250-unit tank quickly, so players pulse the beam only when on target to avoid running dry."}
{"q": "What psychological effect does Lava Gun create?", "a": "Most opponents hesitate to push through an active lava stream, granting the wielder soft control over choke points."}
