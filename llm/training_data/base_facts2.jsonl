This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "When is the Minirocket Tube most effective?", "input": "", "output": "The Minirocket Tube excels in mid-range engagements where homing can compensate for aim, tight spaces where dodging is limited, ambushing single enemies, attacking enemy vehicles or static defenses, and disrupting enemy movement or suppressing high ground. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "What tactics increase the Minirocket Tube\u2019s effectiveness?", "input": "", "output": "Tactics include firing multiple rockets in quick succession to overwhelm evasive players, targeting enemies in narrow corridors or around corners, zooming in to snipe at mid-to-long range and let the homing assist the shot, and jumping while firing to give rockets better vertical tracking on high/low targets. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "In what situations is the Lava Gun strongest?", "input": "", "output": "The Lava Gun is highly effective in tight corridors and small rooms, defensive holds on objectives, close encounters where players rush with shotguns, and flushing enemies out of cover or off nodes. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "What are the weaknesses of the Lava Gun?", "input": "", "output": "Its main drawbacks are very short range, you must remain exposed to maintain the beam leaving you vulnerable to long-range fire, and it is ineffective in open spaces or long hallways where enemies can shoot from afar.

It\u2019s particularly strong when covering wide sightlines, turret locations, flag routes, and power node approaches. It excels when used by a sharpshooter who can stay protected while maintaining firing lanes. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "What are good strategies to counter a Flux Rifle user?", "input": "", "output": "Players can counter the Flux Rifle by using Holoshields to block incoming sniper fire, moving unpredictably and avoiding long sightlines, watching for the visual glint of a scoped Flux user and taking cover, and flanking snipers or engaging them in close-range fights where they\u2019re at a disadvantage. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "How is the Morph-o-Ray used tactically?", "input": "", "output": "It is primarily used for crowd control and disruption. For example, morphing a player rushing you can stop their attack instantly, morphing a turret gunner or flag defender allows your team to push an objective unopposed, and morphed players can be ignored or eliminated safely with another weapon while they are disabled. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "What happens when the Morph-o-Ray is upgraded?", "input": "", "output": "After 3 kill assists, the Morph-o-Ray upgrades and gains the following enhancements: the morphing effect activates much faster (in under one second), and the beam has a slightly longer range.

This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "Where are turrets located in multiplayer maps?", "input": "", "output": "Turrets are usually found at team bases often overlooking the power core or flag spawn for defensive use, at key nodes or strategic map locations (e.g., central high ground), and for example Outpost X12 has a powerful neutral turret at its center and additional base turrets for each team. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "What are the advantages of using a turret?", "input": "", "output": "Turrets offer high damage output, great crowd control at choke points, area denial for objectives, and strong defense against infantry or light vehicles. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "How do players acquire drone bots in multiplayer?", "input": "", "output": "Drone bots can be obtained in two ways: capturing certain node points will automatically spawn drone bots to assist your team, and some maps feature a drone bot pickup which gives the player one or more companion drones.

This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "What are defensive strategies on this map?", "input": "", "output": "Defenders can set traps with Mine Glove around corners and side halls, hold the central crossroad to deny access to all four quadrants, use Lava Gun or Blitz Gun to control narrow choke points, and place Holoshields at tunnel entrances to block enemy pushes. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "How is the terrain on Hoven Gorge layered?", "input": "", "output": "The map has three main layers: the frozen gorge at ground level, the elevated cliff surface (sniping and movement), and the interior cliff tunnel system with strategic nodes and turrets. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}

{"instruction": "What tactics work well in Command Center?", "input": "", "output": "In Command Center, use Gravity Boots to wall-walk and surprise enemies from above. Deploy Holoshields to block flanks and funnel enemy movement. Splash weapons like Gravity Bombs are great for bouncing damage around cover, and controlling the central pillars offers protection and ideal mine placement. In Deathmatch, rely on the Blitz Gun and Lava Gun for quick kills. In Capture the Flag, coordinate attacks with one player walking along the wall while others push from the ground to overwhelm defenders. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "What are strong opening strategies in Siege on Korgon Outpost?", "input": "", "output": "Start by rushing to crank open your southern bridge and capture the southern node to unlock your Hovership. Simultaneously, send a Turboslider or on-foot player to contest the central node. Capturing the central node early opens the ramp system for full vehicle access through the middle of the map. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "How should teams handle the vehicle-heavy nature of Korgon Outpost?", "input": "", "output": "Carry heavy weapons like the Mine Glove to trap narrow paths and use the missile turrets from the central node for anti-vehicle coverage.

This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "What weapons perform best on Marcadia Palace?", "input": "", "output": "The best weapons for this tight map include the Blitz Gun and Lava Gun for close quarters, the N60 Storm and Minirocket Tube for mid-range engagements, and limited use of the Flux Rifle for sniping from the moat toward the central turret. Overall, the layout favors rapid, explosive weapons over long-range dueling. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "What general strategy wins fights on Marcadia Palace?", "input": "", "output": "Controlling the central Minirocket Tube and the turret atop the pillar provides a big advantage. Use the side areas and curved walls for flanking, deploy mines in predictable routes like the moat, and combine Holoshields with high ground control for strong defensive plays. Charge Boots allow for hit-and-run attacks or fast flag escapes. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "How many total capturable nodes are there in Metropolis?", "input": "", "output": "There are at least six nodes: two rooftop \u201cfirst nodes\u201d near each base which unlock Hoverships and defenses, two pyramid towers near center with weapon pickups, and two distant corner rooftops that provide rockets and sniper rifles. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "What\u2019s a strong Siege mode strategy on Metropolis?", "input": "", "output": "Begin by capturing your rooftop node to unlock the Hovership and activate your base defenses. Next, push to secure your pyramid tower for sniping or rockets. Use jump pads and Swingshot routes to avoid turret-covered bridges and move forward node by node to gain spawn points and push toward the enemy base. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "How does Capture the Flag play out on Metropolis?", "input": "", "output": "Flags are likely placed near each team\u2019s base rooftops. Instead of using the long bridges which are heavily guarded by turrets, flag runners can jump between rooftops, use Swingshots, Charge Boots, and grav-ramps to create unpredictable escape routes. Mines and Holoshields are crucial for defending choke points like jump pad landings and Swingshot connections. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "What does Metropolis emphasize in gameplay?", "input": "", "output": "Metropolis emphasizes vertical control and traversal mastery. Players must learn to use Swingshots and jump pads effectively, while managing multi-tier combat between air, rooftops, and ground level.
