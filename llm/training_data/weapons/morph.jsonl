{"instruction": "What is the Morph-o-Ray in UYA multiplayer?", "input": "", "output": "The Morph-o-Ray is a quirky, non-lethal support weapon that emits a short-range continuous beam which transforms enemies into harmless animals (like ducks) after sustained contact. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "Does the Morph-o-Ray deal direct damage?", "input": "", "output": "No, it does not deal any damage. Its only effect is to temporarily morph enemy players into animals, rendering them unable to move or attack for a few seconds. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "How does the Morph-o-Ray function during combat?", "input": "", "output": "The weapon continuously fires a beam. If the beam remains on an enemy for one to two seconds, it triggers the transformation effect, morphing them into a non-combative animal and taking them out of the fight briefly. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "What happens to morphed players in multiplayer?", "input": "", "output": "Morphed players become helpless animals. They cannot move, attack, or use any items or weapons until the effect wears off. During this period, they are highly vulnerable to follow-up attacks. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "What is the Morph-o-Ray\u2019s ammo system?", "input": "", "output": "The Morph-o-Ray has unlimited ammo, allowing it to be used freely. However, it requires precision and sustained contact to trigger the effect, which limits its spammability. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "Does the Morph-o-Ray affect multiple players at once?", "input": "", "output": "No. The beam affects only one enemy at a time and has a limited range, so positioning and aim are critical to using it effectively. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "Do you get kill credit for morphing someone?", "input": "", "output": "No. Morphing a player does not count as a kill. If a morphed player is killed, the kill credit goes to the person who lands the lethal blow, not the one who performed the morph. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "Is there any counterplay for players who get morphed?", "input": "", "output": "Yes. A smart counter is to intentionally jump off the map or into an environmental hazard while morphed. This forces a quick death and respawn rather than waiting helplessly for the effect to end. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "How is the Morph-o-Ray viewed in competitive multiplayer?", "input": "", "output": "While not lethal on its own, the Morph-o-Ray is highly valued by skilled players for its ability to disable enemies at critical moments. In coordinated team play, it creates easy kill setups and strategic advantages. When upgraded, it\u2019s considered a top-tier disruption tool in close combat. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
