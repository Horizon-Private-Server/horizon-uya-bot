This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "How does a player move in UYA?", "input": "", "output": "Players in UYA play in lock-strafe mode, meaning they will stay looking forward while moving to the side. Players can switch to third-person where the camera is not locked when they are using the wrench."}

{"instruction": "What is a side flip?", "input": "", "output": "A side flip in UYA is when a player performs a side flip to evade.

{"instruction": "What are Charge Boots in UYA multiplayer?", "input": "", "output": "Charge Boots are rocket-powered footwear that give players a burst of forward speed, allowing them to dash across long distances or quickly close the gap to objectives and enemies. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "Are Charge Boots always enabled in multiplayer?", "input": "", "output": "No. Charge Boots can be toggled on or off by the match host. On larger maps like Hoven Gorge or Korgon Outpost, they are usually enabled by default to make long-distance movement more manageable. On smaller maps or for slower-paced matches, they may be disabled. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "How were Charge Boots unlocked in the original PS2 version?", "input": "", "output": "In the original PS2 version, Charge Boots were an unlockable feature.

{"instruction": "How does the respawn system work in UYA multiplayer?", "input": "", "output": "When a player is killed, they respawn after a short delay of a few seconds and can choose to respawn either at their team\u2019s base or at any node their team currently controls, making node ownership critical for staying close to combat. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "Why are nodes important in team-based modes?", "input": "", "output": "Captured nodes serve as forward spawn points, allowing players to re-enter the fight closer to objectives and reducing travel time from the base, which greatly improves a team\u2019s map control and momentum. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "How do you capture a node in UYA multiplayer?", "input": "", "output": "To capture a node, a player must destroy the defending AI turrets and soldiers, then interact with a bolt crank to convert it to their team, after which it changes color to reflect ownership and activates as a spawn and resupply point. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "What benefits does a captured node provide?", "input": "", "output": "Captured nodes act as respawn points, dispense specific weapons or ammo, and may activate vehicles or drone bots for your team depending on the map and node type. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}

This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "What happens if your team controls no nodes besides the base?", "input": "", "output": "If your team owns no nodes beyond the base, all respawns are forced back at base, putting your team at a positional disadvantage and making it harder to contest mid-map or offensive objectives. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "What is a good team strategy involving nodes?", "input": "", "output": "Strong teams coordinate to capture and hold forward nodes for better spawn coverage, deny enemy nodes to restrict their respawn options, and use that control to pressure and assault the enemy base while they are forced to return from farther away. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
