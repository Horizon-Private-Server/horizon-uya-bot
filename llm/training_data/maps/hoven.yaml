      answers: 
        - "Hoven Gorge contains seven capturable nodes: one near each team’s base, one in the tunnel inside the central cliff, two on the north and south sides of the cliff, and one beneath the bridge in the frozen gorge."
        - "The map includes a node at each base-side canyon, three nodes embedded in the central cliff, and one in the gorge beneath the bridge."
        - "Capture nodes are distributed across base flanks, interior cliff tunnels, and the central frozen gorge."

      answers: 
        - "Capturing the base-side node provides vehicles and mobility tools, enabling early movement control."
        - "Holding the cliff tunnel node denies enemy snipers and grants long-range weapons for mid-map control."

        - "Securing the cliff-side nodes unlocks turrets with overlapping fields of fire across the gorge."
        - "Teams that hold more nodes can dominate vehicle routes, reinforce faster, and establish superior map pressure."
        - "Controlling multiple nodes provides strategic advantages in elevation, line-of-sight, and defense capability."
        - "Early node control lets teams establish chokepoints and deny enemy reinforcements."
