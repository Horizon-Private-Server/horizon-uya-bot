{"instruction": "What is Outpost X12 in UYA multiplayer?", "input": "", "output": "Outpost X12 is a large, asymmetric desert canyon map on Aridia, featuring six main landmasses\u2014three per team side\u2014separated by chasms and connected via bridges, grav-paths, tunnels, and swingshot targets, with each team\u2019s base on a far island and the entire map surrounded by a death pit. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "Where are the team bases located on Outpost X12?", "input": "", "output": "One team\u2019s base is in the bottom-left and the other\u2019s in the top-right, each positioned behind a tall rock formation and equipped with a player-controlled turret and a nearby Morph-o-Ray pickup for defense. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "How many primary routes lead out from each base on Outpost X12?", "input": "", "output": "Each base offers three advancement routes: a gravity-ramp tunnel, a land bridge, and an upper plateau path, all converging toward the team's first node located inside a central mesa-like structure just outside the base. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "What\u2019s the function of the first node on Outpost X12?", "input": "", "output": "The first node is the gateway to the rest of the map and must be captured to advance; it is guarded by basic turrets and includes two neutral Turbosliders, and capturing it releases a Minirocket Tube and Lava Gun for your team. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "What comes after the first node in terms of progression on Outpost X12?", "input": "", "output": "From the first node, players can advance to a mid-island that connects to two further nodes: one on the right up a grav-ramp plateau that spawns a Hovership, Lava Gun, and Charge Boots, and one on the left up a ledge and destructible bridge that provides a missile turret, Morph-o-Ray, and Minirocket Tube. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "What is the tactical purpose of the right node plateau on Outpost X12?", "input": "", "output": "Capturing the right plateau node gives your team aerial superiority via a Hovership and fast movement options with Charge Boots, enabling aggressive strikes on enemy nodes or base defenses. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "What is the tactical value of the left plateau node on Outpost X12?", "input": "", "output": "The left node includes an anti-air missile turret and drone bots and is a critical defensive asset that helps shoot down Hoverships and Turbosliders, ideal for holding ground and countering air assaults. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "How are the left and right plateau nodes connected on Outpost X12?", "input": "", "output": "A long bridge in the lower map connects Blue\u2019s missile node to Red\u2019s Hovership node, while a mirrored ramp in the upper map links Red\u2019s missile node to Blue\u2019s Hovership node, with each area offering grav-ramps, Morph-o-Ray and Charge Boots pickups, and versa-targets for swinging. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "What is located at the center of the map on Outpost X12?", "input": "", "output": "A hovering round metal platform in the center houses a neutral turret that oversees a large portion of the canyon, usable by either team, but accessible only via Swingshot or Hovership, making it a high-risk, high-reward position. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "How is traversal handled on Outpost X12?", "input": "", "output": "Traversal includes gravity ramps, tunnels, swingshot routes, and destructible or narrow bridges, allowing creative movement and surprise flanking across landmasses, with many opportunities to cut off enemy advances or escape routes. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "What early-game strategy is crucial on Outpost X12 in Siege?", "input": "", "output": "Securing your first node is mandatory, as teams collide there at match start, often leading to intense firefights where area weapons like Lava Gun or Gravity Bomb dominate in tight spaces to secure the node and its powerful spawns. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "What mid-game strategy is effective on Outpost X12?", "input": "", "output": "After securing the first node, prioritize capturing your Hovership node on the right for air control, then use aerial mobility to harass the enemy\u2019s left side while defending your own missile turret plateau and contesting the opponent\u2019s Hovership area. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "What is the strategic function of the central turret platform on Outpost X12?", "input": "", "output": "The neutral turret on the floating central platform can dominate mid-map control by attacking vehicles and infantry around the middle, and if captured by a Hovership drop or swingshot, gives a critical firepower advantage. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "Where are sniper perches located on Outpost X12?", "input": "", "output": "Flux Rifles spawn at the tops of two tall crevices accessible via grav-ramps in the upper part of the map, allowing long-range overwatch of turret zones, node areas, and movement lanes. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "What are effective tactics in CTF mode on Outpost X12?", "input": "", "output": "Flag carriers can exploit the map\u2019s traversal variety by mixing Turboslider jumps, swingshot shortcuts, grav-paths, and destructible bridges to escape with the flag, often chaining routes together for unpredictable escapes. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "How can teams prevent being flanked or surprised?", "input": "", "output": "Maintain situational awareness of grav-ramp exits, swingshot entry points, and destructible bridges, and always communicate node captures or losses, as the many crossing paths make it easy to get flanked or snuck up on. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "What overall strategy leads to victory on Outpost X12?", "input": "", "output": "Coordinate node captures from the base to mid to outer plateaus, use Hoverships for mobility and aerial firepower, secure the missile turret for anti-air control, deny the enemy center turret access, and use traversal routes creatively for both offense and defense. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
