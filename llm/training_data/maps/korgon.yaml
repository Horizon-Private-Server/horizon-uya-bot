        - "Blue's base is supported by Ball Bots, whereas Red relies on Shock Droids for protection."

    map_base_locations: 
        - "The Red and Blue bases are positioned at opposite ends of the jungle island in Korgon Outpost."
        - "Each team spawns at their respective end of the map, separated by bridges, jungle paths, and a central facility."
        - "Base placement is symmetrical in distance but features asymmetrical bridge access and terrain."
        - "Red and Blue teams begin at far ends of the island, with unique access to southern and northern bridge routes."

    map_nodes: 
        - "Korgon Outpost features five major nodes: one outside at each base, two southern nodes near bolt-cranked bridges, and one central node inside the main building."
        - "Nodes are distributed across the hovership nodes, the central facility, and outside northern zones."
        - "Each team has symmetrical southern and northern node access, while the central node is a contested control point."
        - "Node placement supports multi-directional play, encouraging movement through bridges, interior ramps, and elevated terrain."

    map_node_strategic_value: 
        - "Capturing the southern nodes grants a Hovership, a weapon pickup, and access to a side entrance into the central building."
        - "Securing the central node flips internal ramps in your favor, creating a direct Turboslider route to the enemy base."
        - "Northern nodes provide powerful weapons, vehicles, and control over sniper towers overlooking the map."
        - "Controlling more nodes increases access to vehicles, traversal options, and map pressure across all flanks."
        - "Holding the central and northern nodes lets a team dominate movement flow and cut off enemy reinforcements."

    map_trooper_locations: 
        - "There are no neutral troopers or Galactic Rangers present on Korgon Outpost."

        - "The map contains only player-controlled units—no allied or enemy troopers appear."
        - "No neutral trooper factions are involved in gameplay on this map."

    map_trooper_locations: 
        - "Neutral Galactic Ranger troopers guard the central node inside the building and are positioned around nearby node areas."
        - "The central facility is defended by non-player Galactic Rangers who resist both teams."
        - "Several neutral troopers are stationed at key node zones, especially the central building interior."
        - "Galactic Ranger NPCs appear as neutral forces that defend the central node and slow initial captures."

    map_sniper: 
        - "Snipers can occupy the dedicated sniper towers opposite each team's northern node, offering clear views into the enemy base."
        - "Each sniper tower contains a Flux Rifle and provides long-range sightlines across northern and central lanes."
        - "The central northern hill offers additional elevation for snipers to control bridge routes and jungle paths."
        - "High ground around northern nodes and towers enables sustained long-range fire over critical movement corridors."

    map_terrain_features: 
        - "Korgon Outpost features layered terrain including jungle paths, cliffs, and elevated platforms that affect vehicle and foot movement."
        - "The central northern hill offers height advantage and line-of-sight over both bases and major approach routes."
        - "Bridges, side ramps, and vertical interiors of the central building create chokepoints and ambush zones."
        - "Cover is provided by natural foliage, node structures, and platform edges throughout the map."
        - "Gravity ramp paths and destructible bridges introduce dynamic elevation changes and movement options."

    map_vehicle_types: 
        - "Korgon Outpost includes both land and air vehicles—Turbosliders and Hoverships."
        - "Turbosliders spawn at the northern nodes, while Hoverships are unlocked by capturing the southern nodes."
        - "Each team can access Turbosliders and Hoverships by controlling their respective flank nodes."
        - "Vehicle access is tied to node control, with air and ground vehicles available based on map progression."

    map_turboslider_tactics: 
        - "Turbosliders are used to quickly traverse from northern nodes to the center or to flank enemy positions via side ramps."
        - "Capturing northern nodes grants access to Turbosliders, which enable fast pressure on central and southern objectives."
        - "Turbosliders allow teams to contest multiple node zones rapidly, especially when central ramps are flipped in their favor."
        - "They are key to maintaining map control and punishing teams that overextend without holding their side's node routes."

    map_hovership_tactics: 
        - "Hoverships are used to bypass jungle paths and apply aerial pressure to enemy nodes and bridges."
        - "They allow fast reinforcement of the central building and provide overwatch during contested captures."
        - "Players use Hoverships to suppress base exits, scout flanks, and harass Turboslider routes from above."

        - "Snipers stationed in northern towers or on the central hill can take out Hoverships with Flux Rifles."
        - "Minirocket Tubes from northern nodes are effective for ambushing or zoning aerial paths."
        - "Teams can deny Hovership spawns by contesting or capturing the enemy’s southern node early."
        - "Using Holoshields near ramp exits or node approaches disrupts flight paths and forces Hoverships into predictable lines of fire."
