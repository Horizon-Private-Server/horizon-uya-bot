{"instruction": "You are an AI answering UYA multiplayer questions.", "input": "Is offline split-screen balanced for all multiplayer modes?", "output": "Split-screen has no bots, so Siege is unbalanced in 1-on-1; local play is best suited to Deathmatch or small CTF games."}

{"instruction": "You are an AI answering UYA multiplayer questions.", "input": "What were the effects of high latency (lag) in multiplayer?", "output": "High latency made players appear to teleport and caused delayed hit-registration; competitive groups often required hosts to meet minimum connection quality to reduce these issues."}
{"instruction": "You are an AI answering UYA multiplayer questions.", "input": "How did UYA's multiplayer stand out despite being niche?", "output": "Its blend of platforming movement, gadgets, and chaotic weapon variety offered a uniquely fun experience that many fans still regard as one of the PS2’s best online modes."}

{"instruction": "You are an AI answering UYA multiplayer questions.", "input": "Was kill-stealing an issue in casual play?", "output": "Kill-stealing annoyed some casuals because the final blow grants weapon upgrades, but competitive teams often fed kills to specific players on purpose to secure key upgrades quickly."}
{"instruction": "You are an AI answering UYA multiplayer questions.", "input": "Did teams ever intentionally feed kills to teammates?", "output": "Yes. Teams sometimes let a chosen player finish easy kills so that weapon would reach V2 quickly—for example, feeding a Flux Rifle user three kills to unlock one-shot capability."}
{"instruction": "You are an AI answering UYA multiplayer questions.", "input": "Why are players with upgraded weapons targeted heavily?", "output": "An upgraded weapon gives a big power spike; killing its user removes both the threat and the upgrade, so enemies focus fire while allies try to protect that carrier."}
{"instruction": "You are an AI answering UYA multiplayer questions.", "input": "Do weapon and health pickups have predictable respawn timers?", "output": "Pickups respawn on fixed timers—roughly 30 s for most crates—so experienced players time returns to secure items like the Minirocket Tube as soon as they reappear."}
{"instruction": "You are an AI answering UYA multiplayer questions.", "input": "How does node capture work during Siege mode?", "output": "Only one player can crank a node at a time; extra teammates don’t speed it up, so they should guard. Enemy presence in the zone freezes progress until cleared."}
{"instruction": "You are an AI answering UYA multiplayer questions.", "input": "How does recapturing an enemy-owned node differ from capturing a neutral node?", "output": "Neutral nodes convert fast, but flipping an enemy-owned node takes longer, giving defenders a window to respond and making held nodes valuable."}
{"instruction": "You are an AI answering UYA multiplayer questions.", "input": "How important are opening moves in clan practice?", "output": "Clans rehearse map openers—who grabs which node or power weapon—because the first 30 s often decide early momentum, such as securing the Metropolis Hovership."}
{"instruction": "You are an AI answering UYA multiplayer questions.", "input": "What were common score and time limit settings for serious matches?", "output": "Competitive hosts often set 5-flag limits in CTF, 20–30 kills in Deathmatch, and 15-minute timers; some clan scrims removed the timer and played to score only."}
{"instruction": "You are an AI answering UYA multiplayer questions.", "input": "Does UYA have any cooperative multiplayer modes?", "output": "No. Multiplayer is entirely competitive; the only team play is versus other players, not PvE co-op."}
