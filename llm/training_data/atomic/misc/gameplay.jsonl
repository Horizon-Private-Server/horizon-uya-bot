{"q": "What game modes exist in UYA multiplayer?", "a": "Siege, Capture the Flag (CTF), and Deathmatch."}
{"q": "How is Siege mode played?", "a": "Teams defend their power core and attack the enemy's. Capturing nodes provides spawns, weapons, and vehicles to push into the enemy base."}
{"q": "How does a team win in Siege mode?", "a": "Destroy the enemy core. If time expires, the team with more core damage dealt or more nodes held wins."}
{"q": "How is Capture the Flag played?", "a": "Teams steal the enemy flag and return it to their base while defending their own flag."}
{"q": "How many captures are needed to win CTF?", "a": "By default, three captures. Settings can change the capture limit and time limit."}
{"q": "What is Deathmatch mode?", "a": "A mode where players or teams earn points (frags) by defeating opponents. Highest score wins."}
{"q": "Can Deathmatch be team-based?", "a": "Yes. Deathmatch can be free-for-all or team-based. In Team Deathmatch, team frags contribute to a combined score."}
{"q": "Which maps do not support Siege mode?", "a": "Aquatos Sewers, Blackwater Docks, Marcadia Palace, and Command Center."}
{"q": "Which maps feature vehicles?", "a": "Bakisi Isles, Metropolis, Hoven Gorge (Turbosliders only), Outpost X12, and Korgon Outpost."}


{"q": "What is the Morph-o-Ray’s function in UYA multiplayer?", "a": "It emits a beam that morphs enemies into harmless animals."}
{"q": "How long must the Morph-o-Ray beam stay on target to morph?", "a": "Approximately 1–2 seconds of continuous contact."}
{"q": "Does the Morph-o-Ray deal direct damage?", "a": "No, it causes zero damage; it only disables by transformation."}
{"q": "What can morphed players do while transformed?", "a": "Nothing—they cannot move, attack, or use items until the effect ends."}
{"q": "How much ammo does the Morph-o-Ray have?", "a": "It has unlimited ammo in multiplayer."}
{"q": "Does the Morph-o-Ray deal any damage in multiplayer?", "a": "No. The Morph-o-Ray inflicts zero direct damage; it only morphs enemies."}
{"q": "What transformation effect does the Morph-o-Ray cause?", "a": "Hit players are turned into small animals (usually ducks) for a short time."}
{"q": "Can a morphed player fight back?", "a": "No. While morphed they cannot move, shoot, or use items and are completely helpless."}
{"q": "How long does the Morph-o-Ray effect last if the victim survives?", "a": "The transformation wears off after a few seconds, returning the player to normal."}
{"q": "How much ammo does the Morph-o-Ray have in multiplayer?", "a": "It has unlimited ammo; the beam can be fired indefinitely."}
{"q": "How many enemies can the Morph-o-Ray affect at once?", "a": "Only one—its beam morphs a single target at a time."}
{"q": "Who receives kill credit when a morphed player dies?", "a": "Credit goes to whoever lands the lethal blow, not to the player who morphed them."}
{"q": "What desperation counter do players use after being morphed?", "a": "Jumping off the map or into hazards forces a quick suicide, denying the enemy an easy kill."}
{"q": "What upgrade condition applies to the Morph-o-Ray?", "a": "After 3 morph assists it upgrades, reducing morph time and slightly increasing range."}
{"q": "What is a common team use for the Morph-o-Ray?", "a": "Teams disable a high-value target (e.g., flag carrier or rocket user) so teammates can finish them safely."}
{"q": "What does the Mine Glove do in multiplayer?", "a": "It lets players throw proximity mines that stick to the ground and detonate near enemies."}
{"q": "How many mines can a player have active simultaneously?", "a": "Up to 6; placing a seventh removes the oldest mine."}
{"q": "Describe the behavior of a proximity mine once an enemy approaches.", "a": "The mine activates, homes toward the enemy briefly, then explodes for high damage."}
{"q": "How can proximity mines be destroyed?", "a": "Any weapon hit detonates a mine; shooting it from a distance safely clears it."}
{"q": "Which splash weapons efficiently clear minefields?", "a": "Blitz Gun spread or Gravity Bomb blasts can wipe out multiple mines without close approach."}
{"q": "Is dodging an activated mine reliable?", "a": "Once a mine locks on it is hard to evade; prevention by spotting is safer than reaction."}
{"q": "What battlefield role do mines serve?", "a": "Mines create area denial—forcing enemies to slow, check paths, or risk instant damage."}
{"q": "Where are mines most effective for defense?", "a": "Placing mines at flags, power-core doors, or narrow chokepoints protects critical objectives."}
{"q": "How can mines disrupt coordinated pushes?", "a": "A triggered mine splits enemy timing—one player stops to clear it, isolating teammates ahead."}
{"q": "When does the Mine Glove upgrade?", "a": "After 3 mine kills or assists the glove upgrades to V2 mines."}
{"q": "What improvements do upgraded mines receive?", "a": "V2 mines gain larger blast radius and higher damage—two explosions can kill a full-health player."}
{"q": "Give examples of lethal mine placements.", "a": "On a flag pedestal, behind a health crate, or on a jump-pad landing zone often scores surprise kills."}
{"q": "What mindset helps effective mine placement?", "a": "Think like the enemy—plant mines on routes or goodies they will naturally approach."}
{"q": "Should mines be stacked or spread?", "a": "Spread mines to cover wider ground unless certain of a single high-traffic trigger spot."}
{"q": "Do mines damage teammates?", "a": "Friendly mines do not harm teammates, so bases can be densely mined for defense."}
{"q": "Why must you relocate after deploying mines?", "a": "Staying near freshly placed mines risks self-damage if a firefight erupts and they detonate."}
{"q": "How are mines valued in competitive play?", "a": "High-skill players use mines to control flow; teams focus on clearing enemy mines first."}
{"q": "Which weapon is commonly used to clear competitive minefields?", "a": "Gravity Bomb lobbed explosions safely detonate clustered mines."}
{"q": "Can mines herd opponents?", "a": "Strategic mine placement funnels enemies off obvious paths into planned kill zones."}
{"q": "What does the Holoshield Glove deploy?", "a": "It projects a stationary, transparent energy wall that blocks enemy fire."}
{"q": "Can friendly shots pass through a Holoshield?", "a": "Yes—team projectiles and players move through from the rear side unimpeded."}
{"q": "How is a Holoshield destroyed?", "a": "It shatters after absorbing a set amount of damage or after a fixed lifespan."}
{"q": "Can enemies walk through a Holoshield?", "a": "No—enemy bodies and bullets are stopped; they must flank or break the shield."}
{"q": "Does the Holoshield deal damage?", "a": "No; it is purely defensive and inflicts zero harm."}
{"q": "Is the Holoshield a weapon or gadget?", "a": "Classified as a gadget but acquired from weapon crates and occupies a weapon slot."}
{"q": "Does the Holoshield upgrade with kills?", "a": "No—it has no upgrade path regardless of use."}
{"q": "How long does a deployed Holoshield remain?", "a": "A Holoshield stays active only for several seconds or until it absorbs a set amount of damage, whichever comes first."}
{"q": "What type of enemy fire collapses a Holoshield fastest?", "a": "Explosives or continuous high-damage fire (e.g., rockets, Gravity Bombs) deplete a Holoshield’s health rapidly."}
{"q": "How is the Holoshield–Flux Rifle combo used?", "a": "Players throw a Holoshield for cover and snipe safely through it with the Flux Rifle, forcing enemies to destroy the shield before firing back."}
{"q": "How can a flag carrier benefit from a Holoshield?", "a": "Dropping a Holoshield behind the carrier blocks pursuing enemies’ shots during the escape."}
{"q": "Can enemies destroy a Holoshield?", "a": "Yes—focused gunfire or explosives will break the shield, but the time spent shooting it diverts fire from the players behind it."}
{"q": "Does the Holoshield Glove ever upgrade?", "a": "No—Holoshields have no V2 upgrade; every deployment has the same stats."}
{"q": "How do competitive teams use Holoshields at nodes?", "a": "During a node capture, a player deploys a Holoshield to block incoming fire while they crank the bolt."}
{"q": "What is a chained Holoshield tactic in CTF?", "a": "Teammates successively place Holoshields to create a moving corridor that protects a flag carrier across open ground."}
{"q": "Why is the Holoshield pickup high priority?", "a": "Teams value it for critical defensive plays, so they secure the shield crate early and give it to a player with good timing sense."}
{"q": "When do most weapons upgrade to V2?", "a": "After a player earns 3 kills with a weapon without dying, that weapon automatically upgrades from V1 to V2."}
{"q": "What benefits do V2 weapons provide?", "a": "Upgraded weapons hit harder, fire faster, or gain larger splash radius, making them significantly more lethal."}
{"q": "What happens to weapon upgrades upon player death?", "a": "Upgrades are lost on death; the weapon reverts to V1 if reacquired after respawn."}
{"q": "What drops when a player is killed?", "a": "All non-default weapons are dropped in a pack at the death spot, and any player can pick them up."}
{"q": "Do dropped weapons retain V2 status?", "a": "No—dropped weapons revert to their base V1 form when picked up by another player."}
{"q": "What does a generic (green) ammo crate provide?", "a": "Breaking a green ammo crate refills ammunition for multiple weapons in the player’s inventory."}
{"q": "What do weapon-specific crates grant?", "a": "Weapon crates give that particular weapon plus an initial supply of ammo."}
{"q": "How quickly do ammo crates respawn?", "a": "Ammo crates respawn on a short timer, encouraging teams to revisit them frequently."}
{"q": "Why fight for rocket or sniper ammo spawns?", "a": "Powerful weapons have scarce ammo pickups, so controlling their crate locations limits enemy firepower."}
{"q": "What do Nanotech (blue) crates do?", "a": "Nanotech crates instantly restore a large portion of the player’s health when broken."}
{"q": "How often do health crates respawn relative to ammo?", "a": "Health crates respawn more slowly than ammo crates, making health control a critical resource battle."}
{"q": "Is friendly fire on by default?", "a": "Friendly fire is OFF by default, so teammates cannot harm each other with weapons or explosives."}
{"q": "Do ally explosives cause damage?", "a": "Explosions from your own team do not inflict damage on allies, though vehicle blasts can push them slightly."}
{"q": "How can spawn camping be mitigated?", "a": "Because players may respawn at their base or any controlled node, they can choose a safer point if one location is overrun, reducing spawn-camping."}
{"q": "What happens if one team owns every node?", "a": "If a team controls all nodes, the enemy can be locked into base spawns, leading to potential spawn camping despite the respawn-choice system."}
{"q": "Do players get invulnerability after respawn?", "a": "Respawning grants a brief 1-2 second invulnerability shield that ends once the player shoots or the timer expires."}
{"q": "Who configures online match settings?", "a": "The host selects mode, map, time limit, score limit, vehicle and gadget options before the match starts."}
{"q": "What is the player limit per match?", "a": "Up to eight players can join a single game, arranged as free-for-all or split into Red and Blue teams."}
{"q": "Do character skins affect gameplay?", "a": "Skins are purely cosmetic; all have identical hitboxes and abilities."}
{"q": "How are special skins unlocked?", "a": "Certain skins (e.g., Dr. Nefarious, Dan Johnson) unlock through single-player progress or promo codes, but still offer no gameplay benefit."}
{"q": "Are cheat codes usable online?", "a": "Gameplay cheat codes such as infinite ammo are disabled in multiplayer; only cosmetic skins carry over."}
{"q": "Does UYA include an in-game clan system?", "a": "No built-in clan feature exists; teams were organized externally by the community."}
{"q": "What social tools are available in-game?", "a": "The game provides individual stat tracking and a buddy list but no official clan roster."}
{"q": "What are UYA online lobbies called?", "a": "Lobbies are themed as \"cities\" where players chat, host, and join matches."}
{"q": "Why choose a specific city lobby?", "a": "Certain cities became community hubs (e.g., “Metropolis”) where more players gathered to find games quickly."}
{"q": "Which modes normally feature vehicles?", "a": "Vehicles spawn by default in Siege; hosts may enable them in CTF by turning on nodes, but they rarely appear in standard Deathmatch."}
{"q": "What turret types exist?", "a": "Automated mini and gatling turrets fire automatically, while player-controlled turrets let a user mount and manually shoot high-damage rounds."}
{"q": "Can player-controlled turrets be destroyed?", "a": "Yes—enemy fire can overheat or destroy mounted turrets, and the gunner remains a stationary target while using them."}
{"q": "How are base power cores protected at start?", "a": "In Siege, each power core is shielded and invulnerable until the attack phase unlocks it."}
{"q": "When does a core become vulnerable?", "a": "The shield drops after a map-specific timer or once prerequisite nodes are captured, allowing teams to damage the core."}
{"q": "How is a Siege winner decided if cores remain?", "a": "If time expires with both cores alive, the team that inflicted more damage to the opposing core is declared the winner."}
{"q": "Is the Landstalker usable in multiplayer?", "a": "No—UYA multiplayer only features the Hovership and Turboslider; the Landstalker never appears as a player-controlled vehicle."}
{"q": "Does the Landstalker appear anywhere in UYA?", "a": "The Landstalker exists only in single-player as an enemy unit and is absent from multiplayer gameplay."}
{"q": "What was UYA's scrapped mini-mech?", "a": "Developers planned a walker-style mini-mech for multiplayer but cut it; a model and description survive only in the Insomniac Museum."}
{"q": "What does “cycling” mean?", "a": "Cycling is rapidly swapping weapons after each shot (e.g., rocket then Blitz Gun) to stack damage faster than one gun’s refire rate."}
{"q": "What is “lag jumping”?", "a": "Lag jumping is a side-flip while crouched that exploits movement timing to gain extra distance or height when traversing the map."}
{"q": "What is “quickscope” in UYA?", "a": "Quickscoping (or hip-sniping) with the Flux Rifle means firing unscoped or with an instantaneous scope tap to land fast close-range shots."}
{"q": "What is “shield-sniping”?", "a": "Shield-sniping combines placing a Holoshield then shooting through it with the Flux Rifle, giving one-way cover while sniping enemies."}
{"q": "Why use lock-strafe controls?", "a": "Lock-strafe keeps the camera forward while strafing, enabling precise movement and aim simultaneously; competitive players use it exclusively."}
{"q": "Does UYA track online stats?", "a": "Yes—player profiles record wins, losses, kills, and other stats that feed into web-based leaderboards rather than in-game ranks."}
{"q": "How much health do players have?", "a": "All players share a fixed 100-point health pool with no upgrades; Nanotech crates simply restore that baseline value."}
{"q": "What hazards exist on multiplayer maps?", "a": "Maps lack AI hazards; main dangers are falling off edges, into water, or chasms (e.g., Metropolis rooftops, Korgon bridges opened)."}
{"q": "What are UYA’s player limits?", "a": "Multiplayer supports up to 8 players online and up to 4 in local split-screen (multitap required for 3–4)."}
{"q": "Does the PS Vita port include multiplayer?", "a": "No—the PS Vita version of Up Your Arsenal is single-player only; multiplayer was removed."}
{"q": "What are the basic Siege objectives?", "a": "Teams first destroy the two entrance gatling turrets, then teleport inside and damage the enemy power core to win."}
{"q": "Which defenses guard a Siege base?", "a": "Each base has two gatling turrets, two missile turrets, two Ranger bot troopers, and faction-specific wheel-bot or scout-bot spawns."}
{"q": "Why capture nodes in Siege and Attrition Siege?", "a": "Nodes give forward spawns and vehicles; in Attrition they also increase your base turret damage and health."}
{"q": "How do Normal and Chaos CTF differ?", "a": "Normal CTF requires your flag at base to score; Chaos CTF lets you score even while your own flag is away."}
{"q": "How is Deathmatch scoring calculated?", "a": "Players gain +1 per kill and −1 for suicides or environmental deaths; team totals are summed in Team Deathmatch."}
{"q": "Do DM and CTF use respawn nodes?", "a": "No—by default DM and CTF respawn players at base or random points, not at capturable nodes."}
{"q": "What match options can hosts change?", "a": "Hosts choose map, mode variant, score/time limits, and enable or disable specific weapons, vehicles, and gadgets."}
{"q": "How can Charge Boots be toggled?", "a": "A lobby option lets the host give all players Charge Boots, greatly increasing movement speed on large maps."}
{"q": "What weapon do players spawn with in UYA multiplayer?", "a": "Players always spawn with the N60 Storm blaster."}

{"q": "How much damage does each N60 Storm shot inflict?", "a": "Each individual N60 Storm shot deals very low damage."}
{"q": "What role does the N60 Storm serve in combat?", "a": "It is best for mid- or long-range chip damage and finishing injured enemies."}
{"q": "Can N60 Storm shots be dodged easily?", "a": "Yes—the projectiles travel at moderate speed, so agile players can evade them."}
{"q": "Why do players often ditch the N60 Storm quickly?", "a": "Its low DPS makes most players swap it out as soon as stronger weapons are found."}
{"q": "How does the N60 Storm upgrade?", "a": "After 3 kills without dying it upgrades to the N90 Hurricane."}
{"q": "What changes when the N60 Storm becomes the N90 Hurricane?", "a": "The N90 Hurricane roughly doubles the fire rate and increases damage per shot."}
{"q": "What type of weapon is the Blitz Gun?", "a": "The Blitz Gun is a short-range shotgun that fires a cone of energy pellets."}

{"q": "How long does a Holoshield remain active?", "a": "A Holoshield stays up until a set time expires or it absorbs enough damage."}
{"q": "How durable are Holoshields in UYA multiplayer?", "a": "Holoshields absorb significant damage; they flicker and then shatter once their health threshold is reached."}
{"q": "How are Holoshields used strategically in UYA multiplayer?", "a": "Players deploy Holoshields to protect themselves while cranking nodes, guard a flag carrier, or block enemy fire in narrow hallways."}
{"q": "Can players shoot through their own Holoshield in UYA multiplayer?", "a": "Yes—teammates can fire outward through their Holoshield, while enemy shots are blocked coming in."}
{"q": "What is the Hovership in UYA multiplayer?", "a": "The Hovership is a two-seat flying vehicle; the pilot maneuvers and fires twin blaster cannons, while a passenger drops powerful bombs from a secondary launcher."}
{"q": "What is the Turboslider in UYA multiplayer and how does it function?", "a": "The Turboslider is a fast two-seat buggy; the driver steers and fires a front machine gun, and a passenger operates a rear explosive turret. It can also insta-kill by running over enemies."}
{"q": "What risks come with using vehicles in UYA multiplayer?", "a": "Vehicles make players large targets; when a vehicle’s health is depleted it explodes and kills its occupants, so overextending is dangerous."}
{"q": "Which UYA multiplayer maps feature vehicles?", "a": "Bakisi Isles and Korgon Outpost have Hoverships and Turbosliders, Metropolis has Hoverships only, Hoven Gorge has Turbosliders only, and Aquatos Sewers, Blackwater Docks, Marcadia Palace, and Command Center have none."}
{"q": "How are vehicles spawned on maps in UYA multiplayer?", "a": "Vehicles appear only after a team captures specific nodes—for example, a team’s first node in Metropolis spawns a Hovership, while certain nodes on Hoven Gorge spawn Turbosliders."}
{"q": "Can players steal an enemy vehicle in UYA multiplayer?", "a": "Yes—if an enemy pilot is killed and the vehicle remains intact, another player can enter and take control of it."}
{"q": "What happens if a Turboslider runs over a player in UYA multiplayer?", "a": "A pedestrian hit by a speeding Turboslider dies instantly."}
{"q": "How do base defenses react to vehicles in UYA Siege mode?", "a": "Automated base missile turrets prioritize enemy vehicles; attackers usually destroy anti-air turrets before bringing a Hovership into the assault."}
{"q": "What advantage does a skilled Hovership pilot and gunner team have?", "a": "A coordinated Hovership duo can suppress ground targets with the pilot’s blasters while the gunner’s bombs dismantle base defenses, letting their team push objectives safely."}
{"q": "How is the Turboslider used in Capture the Flag matches?", "a": "Teams often load the flag carrier into a Turboslider and boost straight back to base, forcing defenders to land heavy hits quickly or lose the flag."}
{"q": "What weapons and tactics are effective against Hovership attacks?", "a": "Stationary turrets, Flux Rifle head-on shots, and Minirocket Tube salvos—combined with constant strafing on foot—are the most reliable counters to an attacking Hovership."}
{"q": "What are the differences between the Turboslider's front gun and rear turret?", "a": "The driver’s front gun delivers light, continuous chip damage, while the passenger-controlled rear turret fires explosive rounds that deal heavy splash damage, making a two-person crew far deadlier than a solo driver."}
{"q": "How does being inside a vehicle affect player damage taken?", "a": "All incoming damage is applied to the vehicle first; once the vehicle’s health is depleted it explodes, instantly killing anyone inside."}
{"q": "Do vehicles respawn immediately after being destroyed?", "a": "Destroyed vehicles trigger a cooldown before they respawn at their node, so reckless losses can leave a team without vehicle support for up to a minute."}
{"q": "Why might teams intentionally leave a node uncaptured in Siege mode?", "a": "Leaving an enemy vehicle node neutral prevents that team from later recapturing it and regaining access to its Hovership or Turboslider."}
{"q": "How does Charge Boots usage change player movement?", "a": "Double-tapping R1 with Charge Boots grants a high-speed dash at the cost of shooting and sharp turning, enabling rapid traversal on large maps when enabled by the host."}
{"q": "What are jump pads and how can skilled players use them?", "a": "Jump pads launch players along fixed arcs to higher ground or across gaps, and expert snipers time shots to pick airborne enemies mid-flight while agile users chain pads for fast map rotations."}
{"q": "What are Swingshot targets and how do they affect movement?", "a": "Swingshot targets let players grapple and swing over large gaps, creating shortcut routes and unpredictable escape paths that reward precise timing and map knowledge."}
{"q": "How are Gravity Boots used in UYA multiplayer?", "a": "Blue magnet panels let players walk on walls or ceilings, adding vertical combat on maps such as Command Center and Korgon Outpost."}
{"q": "What control scheme do experienced players use in UYA?", "a": "Lock-Strafe mode (camera-aligned movement with R1 to fire) is the preferred scheme because it gives precise aim while dodging."}
{"q": "What is lag jumping and how is it performed?", "a": "Hold crouch (R2) and side-flip while moving forward to gain extra jump distance—useful for gap-crossing but has a predictable arc."}
{"q": "Why do players use side flips and backflips in combat?", "a": "Side and back flips let players evade linear attacks; constant flipping is common to dodge sniper or rocket fire."}
{"q": "How is health restored during multiplayer matches?", "a": "Health only returns by breaking green Nanotech crates, so controlling crate spawns is a key objective."}
{"q": "Is melee combat effective in UYA multiplayer?", "a": "The Omniwrench does minimal damage and is mainly for smashing crates; closing in on an armed foe is almost always fatal."}
{"q": "Does any player have a durability advantage in UYA?", "a": "All players spawn with the same ~100-point health pool; there are no armor upgrades in multiplayer."}
{"q": "Are there classes or loadouts in UYA multiplayer?", "a": "There are no predefined classes—any player can pick up any weapon, so success hinges on map control and skill."}
{"q": "What types of stats were tracked in UYA multiplayer?", "a": "Online leaderboards recorded lifetime kills, deaths, wins, flags captured, and other performance metrics."}
{"q": "Did UYA receive balance patches post-launch?", "a": "The game never received post-launch balance updates, so players adapted to exploits or set community house rules."}
{"q": "Can friendly fire be enabled in UYA multiplayer?", "a": "Friendly fire is always off and cannot be toggled on in any mode."}
{"q": "Can nodes be enabled for Capture the Flag matches?", "a": "Yes, a host can turn nodes on in CTF, adding extra spawn points and vehicles to create a Siege-style hybrid."}
{"q": "What happens if a Siege match timer expires without a core destroyed?", "a": "The match ends in a draw; Attrition Siege was designed to reduce draws by strengthening the team holding more nodes."}
{"q": "What occurs in Normal Capture the Flag when both flags are taken?", "a": "Neither team can score until at least one flag is returned, leading to tense standoffs between flag carriers."}
{"q": "How does gameplay differ in Chaos CTF mode?", "a": "Teams can score even while their own flag is away, resulting in faster, offense-focused, high-scoring games."}
{"q": "Is offline split-screen balanced for all multiplayer modes?", "a": "Split-screen has no bots, so Siege is unbalanced in 1-on-1; local play is best suited to Deathmatch or small CTF games."}
{"q": "Was there a built-in clan system in UYA?", "a": "No; players created clans by adding tags to usernames and organized matches through forums or messages."}
{"q": "Was voice chat supported in UYA multiplayer?", "a": "Yes, a PS2 USB headset enables team-only voice chat, giving coordinated teams a major advantage."}
{"q": "Can two players use split-screen online together?", "a": "Two local players can go online in split-screen, but only the first controller’s headset works for voice chat."}
{"q": "How did matchmaking and server browsing work in UYA?", "a": "Players browsed a list of user-hosted rooms showing map, mode, and player count; there was no automatic matchmaking."}
{"q": "What was DNAS and why did it cause connection errors?", "a": "DNAS (Dynamic Network Authentication System) was Sony’s online authentication for PS2 games; misconfigured networks or server outages triggered DNAS error codes that blocked players from connecting."}
{"q": "What was the online community like during UYA's prime?", "a": "From roughly 2004-2006 the player base was small yet tight-knit, with regulars who recognized one another, ran forum tournaments, and shared strategies on sites like GameFAQs and Insomniac’s boards."}
{"q": "What were the effects of high latency (lag) in multiplayer?", "a": "High latency made players appear to teleport and caused delayed hit-registration; competitive groups often required hosts to meet minimum connection quality to reduce these issues."}
{"q": "How did UYA's multiplayer stand out despite being niche?", "a": "Its blend of platforming movement, gadgets, and chaotic weapon variety offered a uniquely fun experience that many fans still regard as one of the PS2’s best online modes."}
{"q": "Did the community prefer UYA multiplayer over Deadlocked?", "a": "Yes; even after Ratchet: Deadlocked launched, a portion of players stayed with UYA because they favored its wider weapon set and objective modes, keeping its servers active alongside Deadlocked’s."}
{"q": "What emulator is used to play UYA online?", "a": "PCSX2 is the standard PS2 emulator; with its network plugin properly configured, players can join the fan servers and even upscale the game’s resolution."}
{"q": "Did players create their own map callouts and terminology?", "a": "Yes; communities adopted numbered node callouts (e.g., “enemy at node 3”) and coined terms like cycling, lag-jumping, and shield-sniping to communicate tactics efficiently."}
{"q": "Was kill-stealing an issue in casual play?", "a": "Kill-stealing annoyed some casuals because the final blow grants weapon upgrades, but competitive teams often fed kills to specific players on purpose to secure key upgrades quickly."}
{"q": "Did teams ever intentionally feed kills to teammates?", "a": "Yes. Teams sometimes let a chosen player finish easy kills so that weapon would reach V2 quickly—for example, feeding a Flux Rifle user three kills to unlock one-shot capability."}
{"q": "Why are players with upgraded weapons targeted heavily?", "a": "An upgraded weapon gives a big power spike; killing its user removes both the threat and the upgrade, so enemies focus fire while allies try to protect that carrier."}
{"q": "Do weapon and health pickups have predictable respawn timers?", "a": "Pickups respawn on fixed timers—roughly 30 s for most crates—so experienced players time returns to secure items like the Minirocket Tube as soon as they reappear."}
{"q": "How does node capture work during Siege mode?", "a": "Only one player can crank a node at a time; extra teammates don’t speed it up, so they should guard. Enemy presence in the zone freezes progress until cleared."}
{"q": "How does recapturing an enemy-owned node differ from capturing a neutral node?", "a": "Neutral nodes convert fast, but flipping an enemy-owned node takes longer, giving defenders a window to respond and making held nodes valuable."}
{"q": "How important are opening moves in clan practice?", "a": "Clans rehearse map openers—who grabs which node or power weapon—because the first 30 s often decide early momentum, such as securing the Metropolis Hovership."}
{"q": "What were common score and time limit settings for serious matches?", "a": "Competitive hosts often set 5-flag limits in CTF, 20–30 kills in Deathmatch, and 15-minute timers; some clan scrims removed the timer and played to score only."}
{"q": "Does UYA have any cooperative multiplayer modes?", "a": "No. Multiplayer is entirely competitive; the only team play is versus other players, not PvE co-op."}
