      - "Triggered mines home in on enemies briefly before exploding for high damage."
      - "Each mine deals strong single-target or splash damage when its proximity sensor activates."
      - "Damage output is lethal if an enemy triggers the mine at close range."

    weapon_anti_air_capability:
      - "Mines are strictly ground-based and cannot hit airborne targets."

    weapon_upgrade_effects:
      - "V2 mines gain larger blast radius and higher damage—two explosions can kill a full-health player."
      - "Upgraded mines are deadlier and more punishing to clustered opponents."
      - "The blast area increases, and kills become more reliable even on partial proximity triggers."
