    weapon_damage_behavior:
      - "It fires quick, low-damage energy rounds with moderate accuracy and slow projectile speed."
      - "Each shot deals minimal damage, relying on volume of fire to wear enemies down."
      - "The N60 Storm struggles to finish fights on its own due to weak per-shot impact."

      - "With 500 rounds per pickup, it allows long periods of sustained fire."
      - "Its high ammo count balances out its low damage and slow projectile speed."

    weapon_multi_target_utility:
      - "The N60 can hit multiple enemies only if they are aligned, but it lacks splash damage."
      - "It is a single-target weapon; no AoE capability exists in its default or upgraded form."
      - "Targets must be focused one at a time—group damage is not its strength."

    weapon_anti_air_capability:
      - "It can be used to harass airborne targets but rarely hits due to slow projectile speed."
      - "Its low damage and poor hitbox make it unreliable against fast or aerial enemies."
      - "While technically viable for air harassment, it’s not a preferred anti-air option."

      - "Upgraded, it becomes more effective at suppression, though still lacks burst potential."
      - "N90 status improves pressure output but doesn’t fix core damage limitations."

    weapon_defensive_role:
      - "It can suppress flag runners or drones from range, but it’s too weak to defend critical points solo."
      - "The Storm can be used to delay or harass rather than stop aggressive pushes."
      - "Defensively, it chips away at enemies but is rarely a finisher."

    weapon_community_opinion:
      - "It is seen as a weak starting weapon, mainly used for ranged harassment or cleanup kills."
      - "Most players consider it inferior to nearly every other pickup weapon in terms of lethality."
      - "Viewed as a fallback gun—functional but forgettable once stronger options appear."

    weapon_usage_techniques:
      - "Players use it to finish low-health enemies from a distance or break turrets slowly."
      - "The N60 is fired from cover to chip damage safely without committing to a duel."
      - "Its accuracy allows tagging fleeing enemies or sniping static targets like drones."

    weapon_meta_role:
      - "The N60 Storm fills a ranged harassment role, offering chip damage and pressure at mid-long range."
      - "It’s a placeholder tool used to maintain threat until more powerful weapons are found."
      - "In the meta, it exists solely as an opening and fallback weapon."

    weapon_map_control_value:
      - "Its default status means it has no crate control value—teams do not contest it."
      - "Because players spawn with it, map control is unaffected by N60 Storm access."
      - "The N60 Storm is never prioritized—players replace it as soon as better gear is secured."
