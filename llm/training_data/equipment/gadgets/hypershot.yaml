    hypershot_identity:
      - "The Hypershot is a gadget that shoots a green beam to connect with floating green nodes and lets players cross gaps."
      - "It functions as a grappling device, allowing players to swing across spaces using versa-targets."
      - "In UYA, the Hypershot is a traversal tool used to swing over gaps or reach elevated areas."

    hypershot_node_definition:
      - "A Hypershot node is a floating green target that the Hypershot latches onto for swinging."
      - "These green versa-targets are used as anchors for the Hypershot’s grappling beam."
      - "Hypershot nodes are stationary green points that allow traversal when targeted with the Hypershot."

    hypershot_match_usage:
      - "Players use the Hypershot by aiming at versa-targets to swing across gaps or climb terrain."
      - "In matches, the Hypershot is used for mobility—swinging across platforms or skipping obstacles."
      - "Activating the Hypershot at a versa-target launches the player into a swing that can be chained or redirected mid-air."

    hypershot_map_dependencies:
      - "Maps like Metropolis, Outpost X12, and Blackwater City require Hypershot traversal to access key areas."
      - "Some maps feature objectives or crates that are only reachable using Hypershot swings."
      - "Certain routes on maps like Metropolis are locked without proper Hypershot usage, making it essential for navigation."
