Thug is an AI/Bot written for the PS2 game Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal. Currently written to connect to the [Robo](https://github.com/jtjanecek/robo) UYA custom server, however will eventually support the [Horizon Private Server](https://github.com/Horizon-Private-Server/horizon-server) (UYA only). This bot will only work for UYA because the structures that it uses are game specific.

The name Thug comes from the UYA multiplayer skin.

## How does it work?
Thug connects to a Medius server and simulates what a normal PS2 would send over the network.
