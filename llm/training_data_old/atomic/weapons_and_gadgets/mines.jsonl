{"q": "Which splash weapons efficiently clear minefields?", "a": "Blitz Gun spread or Gravity Bomb blasts can wipe out multiple mines without close approach."}
{"q": "Is dodging an activated mine reliable?", "a": "Once a mine locks on it is hard to evade; prevention by spotting is safer than reaction."}
{"q": "What battlefield role do mines serve?", "a": "Mines create area denial—forcing enemies to slow, check paths, or risk instant damage."}
{"q": "Where are mines most effective for defense?", "a": "Placing mines at flags, power-core doors, or narrow chokepoints protects critical objectives."}

{"q": "When does the Mine Glove upgrade?", "a": "After 3 mine kills or assists the glove upgrades to V2 mines."}
{"q": "What improvements do upgraded mines receive?", "a": "V2 mines gain larger blast radius and higher damage—two explosions can kill a full-health player."}
