        - "In addition to basic turrets, Shock Droids defend the Blue side and Ball Bots secure the Red side."

    map_base_locations: 
        - "The Red base is positioned on the far left island, while the Blue base is located on the far right island of the map."
        - "Teams spawn on opposite horizontal ends of the map, with a series of nodes and landmasses between them."
        - "Outpost X12 features a left-right base layout, with each base placed at the edge of the canyon system."
        - "Red and Blue bases are located on outer islands connected to central terrain by bridges, tunnels, and ramps."

    map_nodes: 
        - "Outpost X12 has six key nodes: one starting node just outside each base, two mid-map plateau nodes with anti-vehicle defenses, and two hovership nodes."
        - "The mid-map contains two high ground plateau on each side: nodes—one offers a Hovership and the other provides anti-air defenses."
        - "A central hovering node is accessible via Swingshot or Hovership and provides control over mid-map with a neutral turret."
        - "Nodes are distributed horizontally across the map, requiring control of paths between bases, plateaus, and the floating center."

    map_node_strategic_value: 
        - "Capturing the starting node outside your base is essential to unlock access to the rest of the map and its traversal options."
        - "The right plateau node offers aerial superiority through Hovership control and fast movement via Charge Boots."
        - "The left plateau node provides strong defensive capabilities with a missile turret and drone bots."
        - "Holding the central hovering turret gives mid-map control and can suppress enemy movement across bridges and ramps."
        - "Teams that capture more nodes gain vehicles, weapon pickups, and positional dominance over critical paths and objectives."

    map_trooper_locations: 
        - "Neutral Galactic Ranger troopers spawn at the base-adjacent nodes near each team’s starting area."
        - "Outpost X12 includes non-player troopers stationed at the first nodes just outside both team bases."
        - "Galactic Rangers appear as neutral defenders at the two initial capture nodes near the Red and Blue bases."
        - "NPC troopers guard the base-side nodes to delay early progression and contest initial captures."

    map_sniper: 
        - "Snipers can use Flux Rifles from crevices accessible via grav-ramps in the upper parts of the map for high-ground control."
        - "The elevated sniper spots provide long sightlines over node routes, bridges, and plateau transitions."
        - "Sniping positions near the upper ramps give players vision over key movement chokepoints and vehicle lanes."
        - "Outpost X12's vertical crests and cliffs enable snipers to cover both flanks and contest central node control safely."

    map_terrain_features: 
        - "Outpost X12 features significant elevation changes with plateaus, cliffs, tunnels, and hovering platforms."
        - "Narrow bridges, grav-ramps, and destructible structures force players into choke points and vertical engagements."
        - "Cover is provided by mesas, tunnel entrances, and terrain edges that break line of sight between nodes."

    map_vehicle_types: 
        - "Outpost X12 includes both air and land vehicles: Turbosliders and Hoverships."
        - "Turbosliders spawn at each team’s first node near their base."
        - "A Hovership is available at the right plateau node once captured."
        - "Vehicle use is critical for traversing the large map quickly and contesting distant nodes."

    map_turboslider_tactics: 
        - "Turbosliders allow rapid traversal between nodes and are essential for contesting mid-map early in the match."
        - "Players use Turbosliders from their first node to push into the plateau zones before the enemy can react."
        - "Because of the large map layout, Turbosliders help maintain pressure on multiple fronts and secure fast reinforcements."
        - "They are key for quickly reaching and holding high-value plateau or sniper-access nodes."

    map_hovership_tactics: 
        - "Hoverships provide aerial dominance and are ideal for striking plateau nodes or attacking bases from unexpected angles."
        - "They enable quick transitions across chasms, bypassing ground routes and pressuring unguarded objectives."
        - "Players use Hoverships to support teammates from above, scout enemy positions, and contest the central turret node."
        - "Securing the right plateau node grants Hovership access, giving teams a major advantage in map control and mobility."

    map_counter_air_dominance_strategies: 
        - "Capturing the left plateau node provides a missile turret and drone bots for anti-air defense."
