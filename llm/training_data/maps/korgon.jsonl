{"instruction": "What is Korgon Outpost in UYA multiplayer?", "input": "", "output": "Korgon Outpost is a medium-large jungle island map set on Tyhrranosis, based on Kavu Island from the single-player mission \u201cOperation: Island Strike.\u201d It features nearly symmetrical base layouts, multiple nodes, vehicles, and layered terrain, with a central building newly added for multiplayer. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "Where are the team bases located on Korgon Outpost?", "input": "", "output": "The Red and Blue bases are located at opposite ends of the island. Each base includes a closed southern bridge, a bolt crank to open it, and a northern bridge angled toward the far side of the island. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "What is unique about the central building in Korgon Outpost?", "input": "", "output": "The central building did not exist in the single-player version. It houses a crucial node that controls the configuration of internal ramps, influencing vehicle access from base to base. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "How are the southern bridges activated on Korgon Outpost?", "input": "", "output": "Each team can use a bolt crank at their base to lower their southern bridge. This grants access to the jungle path leading to the team\u2019s southern node. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "What happens when a southern node is captured on Korgon Outpost?", "input": "", "output": "Capturing a southern node unlocks a Hovership spawn, opens a side entrance to the central building, and grants a Nanotech crate, Charge Boots, and a weapon (Morph-o-Ray on one side, Lava Gun on the other). This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "Are the southern nodes symmetrical on Korgon Outpost?", "input": "", "output": "Yes. While the specific weapons differ (one side has Morph-o-Ray, the other Lava Gun), both nodes offer equivalent resources and access benefits. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "How are the northern bridges handled in Korgon Outpost?", "input": "", "output": "Northern bridges cannot be opened from the base side. They are activated from the far (middle) side. Players can swingshot across versa-targets if the bridge is still closed. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "Why might teams leave the northern bridge closed on Korgon Outpost?", "input": "", "output": "Keeping it closed creates a defensive bottleneck, forcing enemies to use slower and riskier swingshot or flanking routes. However, it also limits your team\u2019s own mobility. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "What is the central node\u2019s function on Korgon Outpost?", "input": "", "output": "The central node sits on an upper platform inside the central building. Capturing it gives access to health, ammo, a Holoshield, and flips the internal ramps to favor the controlling team\u2019s Turboslider path\u2014from base, through the building, to enemy side. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "What is the strategic value of the central node on Korgon Outpost?", "input": "", "output": "Controlling the central node effectively creates a drivable \u201chighway\u201d through the middle of the map for the owning team\u2019s Turbosliders, allowing quick and direct vehicle attacks on the enemy base. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "What is beyond the northern bridges on Korgon Outpost?", "input": "", "output": "Each side has a northern node that grants a Turboslider and spawns high-tier weapons: a Mine Glove and Minirocket Tube. These nodes flank a central northern hill. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "What is on the central northern hill on Korgon Outpost?", "input": "", "output": "A Lava Gun spawns at the top, offering line-of-sight into both base areas and complete coverage of northern routes. It is ideal for snipers or heavy weapon users. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "What do the sniper towers contain on Korgon Outpost?", "input": "", "output": "Each team has a sniper tower across from the northern Turboslider node. These towers contain a Flux Rifle and overlook the enemy base, allowing for long-range suppression. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "How many major node points are there in Korgon Outpost?", "input": "", "output": "Six: two southern (one per team), one central (controls ramp flow), two northern (vehicles + heavy weapons), and the base core on each side. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "Why might a team delay opening their southern bridge on Korgon Outpost?", "input": "", "output": "To prevent a quick enemy rush. However, this risks losing the Hovership and key early weapons. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "What is a risky but rewarding tactic involving the northern bridge on Korgon Outpost?", "input": "", "output": "A player can swingshot across the unopened northern bridge, open it from the far side, and capture the enemy\u2019s northern node before they arrive. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "What tactics work in CTF mode on Korgon Outpost?", "input": "", "output": "Use gravity ramps and ceilings to circumvent gates. A flag runner might Charge Boot from the enemy base through the central building or grav-walk around unopened bridges to reach friendly territory unseen. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "What overall gameplay themes define Korgon Outpost?", "input": "", "output": "Korgon Outpost emphasizes multi-front coordination, vehicle combat, node control, and dynamic map flow through bridges, swingshots, and central ramp manipulation. Holding the center often determines vehicle dominance and map control. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
