      answers:
        - "Metropolis is a large vertical map set on planet Kerwan’s urban skyline, featuring interconnected skyscraper rooftops."
        - "The layout centers around high-rise platforms, bridges, and towers, with traversal routes like Swingshot targets and jump pads."
        - "Gameplay unfolds across multiple vertical layers, emphasizing aerial movement and rooftop control."
        - "Bases are positioned on opposite rooftops, while mid-map nodes and towers offer key control points."
        - "The environment blends cityscape architecture with open-air hazards, making verticality and spacing essential to movement."

    - fact_type: map_nicknames
      answers:
        - "Metropolis is commonly referred to as 'Metro' by players."
        - "'Metro' is the standard shorthand for Metropolis in casual matches."
        - "Players usually call Metropolis simply 'Metro'."
        - "The map is often abbreviated as 'Metro' in voice comms and lobbies."

    - fact_type: map_base_defenses
      answers:
        - "Shock Droids defend the Blue team’s base, while Ball Bots protect the Red team’s side."
        - "Alongside standard gatling turrets, Red has Ball Bots and Blue has Shock Droids for additional defense."
        - "Each team is equipped with different support units—Blue fields Shock Droids, Red deploys Ball Bots."
        - "Gatling turrets cover both bases, with Blue supported by Shock Droids and Red reinforced by Ball Bots."

    - fact_type: map_base_locations
      answers:
        - "The Red and Blue bases are located on opposite skyscraper rooftops at the north and south ends of the map."
        - "Teams spawn on elevated rooftops at the far north and south edges of Metropolis."
        - "Base placement is symmetrical, with each team starting on a high-rise platform at opposite ends."
        - "Red and Blue bases sit on large rooftops at either end of the city skyline, connected by bridges and vertical paths."

    - fact_type: map_nodes
      answers:
        - "Metropolis contains six major capturable nodes: two near each team's base, two on the central pyramid towers (often called the nipple nodes), and two on corner rooftops."
        - "Nodes are located on base-adjacent rooftops, mid-map towers (often called the nipple nodes), and distant rooftop flanks."
        - "Each team’s first node is near their spawn, with other nodes placed on elevated towers and side platforms."
        - "Node distribution favors vertical and lateral spacing—each zone provides access to weapons, vehicles, or traversal routes."

    - fact_type: map_node_strategic_value
      answers:
        - "Capturing the Hovership node provides a Hovership, granting early map control."
        - "Owning more nodes ensures faster traversal, better item access, and sustained pressure across all vertical layers."
        - "Teams that dominate node control can leverage vehicles, turrets, and elevation to overwhelm opponents."

    - fact_type: map_trooper_locations
      answers:
        - "No neutral Galactic Rangers are present on Metropolis."
        - "Metropolis does not include any neutral troopers."

    - fact_type: map_sniper
      answers:
        - "Snipers often position themselves on corner rooftops or Gravity Boot towers, which offer elevated views across major routes."
        - "High perches near node spawns provide Flux Rifles and allow control over Swingshot and bridge paths."
        - "The verticality of Metropolis enables long sightlines between rooftops, ideal for sniping chokepoints and node approaches."
        - "Controlling elevated sniper zones allows teams to deny access to Hovership routes and punish exposed traversals."

    - fact_type: map_terrain_features
      answers:
        - "Metropolis features extreme verticality with layered rooftops, ramps, and mid-air traversal zones."
        - "Cover is provided by bridge walls, node structures, and rooftop equipment, supporting both defense and ambushes."
        - "Players navigate between high and low platforms using jump pads, Swingshots, and Gravity Boot surfaces."
        - "The absence of railings on most platforms creates environmental hazards that reward spatial awareness."

    - fact_type: map_vehicle_types
      answers:
        - "Metropolis features Hoverships as its primary vehicle type."
        - "Hoverships spawn at each team’s first rooftop node once captured."
        - "Only aerial vehicles are present; no ground-based vehicles appear on this map."
        - "Vehicle access is tied to node control—capturing the base-adjacent node unlocks a Hovership."

    - fact_type: map_hovership_tactics
      answers:
        - "Hoverships are ideal for aerial harassment, quickly repositioning across rooftops to support pushes or defense."
        - "They can be used to hover above enemy routes, intercept flag carriers, and deny access to exposed nodes."
        - "Players often use Hoverships to suppress enemy snipers and contest elevated positions from the air."
        - "Aerial dominance through Hoverships enables teams to control vertical space and apply pressure across multiple lanes."
