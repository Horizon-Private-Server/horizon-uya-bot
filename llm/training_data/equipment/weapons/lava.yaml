    weapon_anti_air_capability:
      - "It is ineffective against distant airborne targets but can hit jumping players at close range."
      - "Due to limited vertical reach, it’s weak against fliers but can hit aerial targets nearby."

      - "Players rate it as a top-tier defensive tool in the right setting, but highly map-dependent."

      - "Controlling Lava Gun crates ensures teams can hold territory where long-range weapons can’t reach."
