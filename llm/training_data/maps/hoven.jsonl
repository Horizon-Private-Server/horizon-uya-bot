{"instruction": "What is Hoven Gorge in UYA multiplayer?", "input": "", "output": "Hoven Gorge is a large, complex map set on a frosty tundra planet, featuring open fields, a central frozen gorge, cliffside tunnels, and vehicle-compatible terrain. It is adapted from R&C1\u2019s Hoven setting. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "How is Hoven Gorge laid out?", "input": "", "output": "The map is divided by a massive frozen gorge. Each team\u2019s base is located in a corner\u2014Red in the southwest, Blue in the northeast\u2014with a long bridge spanning the gorge as the central symmetry line. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "Is Hoven Gorge symmetrical?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, it is mirrored across the central bridge, though each team\u2019s layout is rotated 90 degrees (so one team\u2019s left is the other\u2019s right). This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "What traversal options exist near each team\u2019s base on Hoven Gorge?", "input": "", "output": "Near each base is a side canyon with a destructible bridge. Players can either extend the bridge using a bolt crank or swing across using versa-targets if the bridge has been destroyed. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "Why destroy the small bridge near your own base on Hoven Gorge?", "input": "", "output": "Destroying the bridge prevents enemy Turbosliders from driving directly into your base, forcing attackers to take slower routes and making it easier to set up defensive chokepoints. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "What is located at each team\u2019s first capturable node on Hoven Gorge?", "input": "", "output": "Each team\u2019s first node is in a sheltered area across a chasm from the base. Capturing it spawns a Turboslider, a Lava Gun, and Charge Boots, providing mobility and firepower. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "What is the central cliff structure on the map on Hoven Gorge?", "input": "", "output": "A tall cliff runs across the center of the map. Players can reach it using jump pads on either side, and additional jump pads on top lead into an interior tunnel. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "What is found inside the cliff tunnel on Hoven Gorge?", "input": "", "output": "Inside the tunnel is a node located on the roof of the tunnel chamber. Capturing it gives the team two Flux Rifle crates, allowing snipers to cover the gorge from above. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "What additional nodes exist within the cliff on Hoven Gorge?", "input": "", "output": "There are two more nodes, one on each side of the cliff (north and south). Capturing them provides access to turret emplacements on platforms overlooking the gorge and key approach routes. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "What is the purpose of the central node beneath the bridge on Hoven Gorge?", "input": "", "output": "Located directly beneath the central bridge in the gorge, this node is guarded by an anti-vehicle missile turret and has two Holoshield pickups. Controlling this node gives a team mid-map dominance and anti-vehicle support. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "What pickups and defenses are located near each base on Hoven Gorge?", "input": "", "output": "Each base includes a Morph-o-Ray pickup and a group of drone bots that provide passive defensive support. The terrain also includes cover structures and canyon paths for defenders. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "What is a strong strategy for Siege mode on Hoven Gorge?", "input": "", "output": "Secure your nearby node and destroy the bridge to your base. Then rush the central cliff tunnel node to deny the enemy snipers, while also contesting the missile turret node under the bridge for anti-vehicle defense. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "How should roles be split on large maps like Hoven Gorge?", "input": "", "output": "Teams should divide responsibilities: some players capture and defend key nodes, some use vehicles (Turbosliders) to harass or rush, and others take sniping positions on the cliff with the Flux Rifle. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "How can the interior turret platforms be used strategically on Hoven Gorge?", "input": "", "output": "Capturing the north and south interior cliff nodes gives your team turret control over both sides of the gorge. These turrets can cover overlapping fields of fire, creating a deadly defensive net. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "What strategies work well for CTF on Hoven Gorge?", "input": "", "output": "Players may infiltrate the base via one route (e.g., swingshot over side canyon), then escape via another (e.g., Charge Boot across the frozen lake). However, long sightlines from cliff snipers or turrets make this dangerous, so coordination and Holoshields are important. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "What is the core gameplay emphasis on Hoven Gorge?", "input": "", "output": "Hoven Gorge rewards combined arms tactics. Success depends on smart coordination between infantry, vehicles, turrets, and snipers, with focus on controlling key chokepoints like the cliff tunnel and gorge floor nodes. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
