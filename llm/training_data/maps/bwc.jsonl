It features two opposing city \u201cislands\u201d separated by water, with bases on elevated platforms at the north and south ends. The map is adapted from the \u201cOperation: Black Tide\u201d Ranger mission. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "What connects the two base platforms in Blackwater City?", "input": "", "output": "A broad central bridge connects each team\u2019s round base platform. Additionally, Swingshot (versa-target) routes provide alternate paths between sides and elevated areas. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "What is located on the central platform in Blackwater City?", "input": "", "output": "Each base leads up to a central round platform containing pickups such as a Holoshield Glove, Mine Glove, and Charge Boots. Each central platform also has a mounted turret that can be used for defense or suppressing enemy movement. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "What are the elevated side platforms in Blackwater City?", "input": "", "output": "On either side of the central structure, two small elevated platforms can be reached by curving ramps. These platforms have capturable nodes and are initially guarded by AI turrets. Each node unlocks powerful weapon pickups. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "What do the side node platforms provide when captured in Blackwater City?", "input": "", "output": "One platform grants a Minirocket Tube and Lava Gun, while the other grants a Flux Rifle and Morph-o-Ray.

Versa-targets (Swingshot hooks) allow players to swing between the side node platforms and between various points on the map, enabling dynamic movement and flanking. This is specific to UYA multiplayer."}
{"instruction": "How do nodes function in Siege mode on Blackwater City?", "input": "", "output": "In Siege mode, each side node acts as a capturable point, and it\u2019s likely each base also has a node.
