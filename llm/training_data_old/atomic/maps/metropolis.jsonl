{"q": "Describe the setting and theme of Metropolis in UYA multiplayer.", "a": "Metropolis is a large, vertical map set on planet Kerwan's cityscape, based on the 'Operation: Urban Storm' Ranger mission."}
{"q": "What terrain features define Metropolis?", "a": "The map includes skyscraper rooftops, bridges, Swingshot paths, turrets, nodes, and multi-layered combat zones."}
{"q": "Where are the team bases positioned on Metropolis?", "a": "Each team starts on a rooftop at opposite ends of the map—north and south."}
{"q": "What is located at the first elevated node on Metropolis?", "a": "The node grants a Hovership, key weapons like the Morph-o-Ray and Lava Gun, and activates automated base defenses."}
{"q": "Why is the first elevated node important in Metropolis?", "a": "It is a high-priority early-game capture that provides vehicles, powerful weapons, and defensive advantages."}
{"q": "What is the purpose of the jump pads near the pyramid towers in Metropolis?", "a": "They allow players to skip the long bridge and jump directly to the enemy’s first node rooftop for surprise attacks."}
{"q": "How do jump pads affect strategy in Metropolis?", "a": "They bypass turreted routes and enable fast vertical traversal, changing typical push patterns."}
{"q": "What tactical advantage do corner sniper towers offer in Metropolis?", "a": "They give players high ground for long-range cover and a launch point to contest the enemy’s corner node."}
{"q": "What can players deny by controlling the enemy’s corner node in Metropolis?", "a": "They can deny opponents access to key weapons and maintain aerial suppression from above."}
{"q": "How should Hoverships be used on Metropolis?", "a": "Hoverships are ideal for aerial harassment, defending nodes, and fast map traversal."}
{"q": "Why is controlling the first node crucial for aerial control in Metropolis?", "a": "It ensures Hovership access and enables airstrikes on enemy rooftops early in the match."}
{"q": "How can Holoshields be deployed strategically in Metropolis?", "a": "Players can throw Holoshields mid-air to block Swingshot paths or place them on jump pad landings to disrupt enemy momentum."}
{"q": "What does advanced Holoshield placement achieve in Metropolis?", "a": "It delays attackers, creates ambush zones, and protects key transition points."}
{"q": "What is the overall gameplay style of Metropolis?", "a": "Metropolis emphasizes acrobatic, three-dimensional gameplay across rooftops, mid-air platforms, and vertical towers."}
{"q": "How is map control achieved on Metropolis?", "a": "It comes from mastering vertical traversal, capturing key nodes, and leveraging vehicles, sniping positions, and Swingshot paths."}
{"q": "How many capturable nodes exist in Metropolis?", "a": "At least six: two rooftop first nodes, two pyramid tower nodes, and two distant corner rooftops."}
{"q": "What is a strong Siege strategy on Metropolis?", "a": "Capture your rooftop node for Hovership and defenses. Secure your pyramid tower next. Use jump pads and Swingshot routes to avoid turret bridges and advance node by node."}
{"q": "How is Capture the Flag played on Metropolis?", "a": "Flags are near base rooftops. Avoid turret bridges by jumping between rooftops, using Swingshots, Charge Boots, and grav-ramps. Defend choke points with mines and Holoshields."}
{"q": "What gameplay emphasis does Metropolis have?", "a": "Vertical control, traversal mastery, multi-tier combat, and coordinated node control for weapons and vehicles."}
{"q": "What is Metropolis in UYA multiplayer?", "a": "Metropolis is a large vertical map set in the city of Kerwan with skyscraper rooftops connected by bridges and swingshot targets."}
{"q": "What environmental hazard is present in Metropolis?", "a": "Most platforms lack safety rails, so players can fall to their death."}
{"q": "Where are the bases located on Metropolis?", "a": "Bases are on opposite skyscraper rooftops at the north and south ends of the map."}
{"q": "What connects the bases on Metropolis?", "a": "Bridges and towers connect the bases, with Hypershot routes available for traversal."}
{"q": "What traversal tools are prominent on Metropolis?", "a": "The map uses Hypershot targets and Gravity Boots to access nodes and sniper positions."}
{"q": "How many capturable nodes are in Metropolis?", "a": "There are at least six major capturable nodes."}
{"q": "What benefits do the first rooftop nodes provide?", "a": "They grant a Hovership spawn and base defenses when captured."}
{"q": "Where are other nodes located in Metropolis?", "a": "Two pyramid-shaped towers near the center each hold nodes, and two distant corner rooftops have additional nodes with power weapons or gadgets."}
{"q": "Where is each team's first node on Metropolis?", "a": "Each team's first node is located near their base."}
{"q": "What does capturing a first node in Metropolis provide?", "a": "Capturing the first node unlocks a Hovership spawn and may activate nearby turrets."}
{"q": "What is the advantage of controlling Gravity Boot tower nodes in Metropolis?", "a": "These nodes provide a direct Charge Boots route toward the enemy base and elevated sniping positions."}
{"q": "Where do Hoverships spawn on Metropolis?", "a": "Hoverships spawn at the first nodes near each base and potentially at certain other captured nodes."}
{"q": "What weapon pickups are on Metropolis?", "a": "Flux Rifles are on high perches, Minirocket Tubes and Gravity Bombs are on mid-map towers, and Charge Boots are on certain platforms."}
{"q": "What flag carrier tactic is common on Metropolis?", "a": "Flag carriers often use side Hypershot nodes and Gravity Boot towers to avoid the central bridge and escape chasers."}
{"q": "How can Charge Boots be used creatively on Metropolis?", "a": "Players can sprint off high platforms or Gravity Ramps, engage Charge Boots mid-air, and reach distant or inaccessible ledges."}
